# Holy Bible Reading Time

The purpose for this was just to get the number of words per chapter in the Holy Bible, and determine the reading time per chapter assuming the person reads 200 words a minute. (KJV Bible Version)


To view general results open [bible.csv](bible.csv).

To view extra "facts" derived from the data open [extra.txt](extra.txt).

To view how much words in each book and how long it would take in minutes and hours to read each book open [bible_books.csv](bible_books.csv).

[bible.txt](bible.txt) is a 2 column list of "book chapter_count."
